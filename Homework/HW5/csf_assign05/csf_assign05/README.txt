Synchronization Report

Critical Sections

1. Server::find_or_create_room

Explanation:
- Critical Section: Operations involving the `m_rooms` map (insertion and lookup).
- How Determined: Identified as a critical section because multiple threads could concurrently attempt to create or find a room, leading to a data race.
- Synchronization Primitives: Used `Guard` (scoped lock) to ensure mutual exclusion while accessing and modifying the `m_rooms` map.
- Why Chose This Primitive: `Guard` provides a convenient and safe way to manage locks, ensuring that the critical section is protected from concurrent access.
- Avoiding Hazards: The use of `Guard` prevents race conditions by ensuring that only one thread at a time can modify the map, avoiding inconsistencies.

2. MessageQueue::enqueue

Explanation:
- Critical Section: Enqueuing a message into the `m_messages` queue and signaling availability with `sem_post`.
- How Determined: Identified as a critical section because multiple threads could concurrently enqueue messages and signal availability.
- Synchronization Primitives: Used `Guard` for protecting the `m_messages` queue and ensuring exclusive access during the enqueue operation.
- Why Chose This Primitive: `Guard` provides simplicity and safety for protecting the critical section, while `sem_post` is used to signal availability outside the lock to avoid potential deadlock situations.
- Avoiding Hazards: The lock ensures mutual exclusion during enqueue, preventing race conditions, and `sem_post` is safely executed outside the lock to prevent deadlock situations.

3. MessageQueue::dequeue`

Explanation:
- Critical Section: Dequeuing a message from the `m_messages` queue.
- How Determined: Identified as a critical section because multiple threads could concurrently attempt to dequeue messages.
- Synchronization Primitives: Used `Guard` to ensure mutual exclusion during the dequeue operation.
- Why Chose This Primitive: `Guard` ensures exclusive access to the critical section, preventing race conditions during dequeuing.
- Avoiding Hazards: Proper use of `Guard` ensures that only one thread at a time can dequeue a message, avoiding race conditions.

4. Room Class Functions (add_member, remove_member, broadcast_message)

Explanation:
- Critical Section: Modifying the `members` set in the `Room` class.
- How Determined: Identified as a critical section because multiple threads could concurrently modify the `members` set.
- Synchronization Primitives: Used `Guard` to ensure mutual exclusion during operations that modify the `members` set.
- Why Chose This Primitive: `Guard` provides simplicity and safety for protecting the critical sections involving set modification.
- Avoiding Hazards: Proper use of `Guard` ensures that only one thread at a time can modify the `members` set, preventing race conditions.

Overall Synchronization Strategy

- Explanation: The synchronization strategy relies on the use of the `Guard` object for managing locks and ensuring mutual exclusion in critical sections where shared data is accessed and modified.
- Reasoning: `Guard` simplifies the process of acquiring and releasing locks in a scoped manner, reducing the likelihood of errors related to lock management.
- Avoiding Hazards: The careful placement of `Guard` objects ensures that critical sections are properly protected from concurrent access, minimizing the risk of race conditions and deadlocks.
